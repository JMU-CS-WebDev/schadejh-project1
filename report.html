1,2,3,4,5,6) Theme is about deadmau5 and 5 of his best songs from different albums with youtube links to the individual song and to the entire album. Each of these are on 5 separate pages (plus an index page) where all pages have a header and navigation links.

7) I need to learn how to use stylesheets.

8,9) Images are included on the site for each page, as well as a favicon for each page.

10) I need to learn how to put JavaScript/CSS, etc. in a separate file and call it.

11) No third party tools used.

12) Validated using W3C's Nu Validator.

13,14,15,16,17) Content is aligned and uses multiple fonts throughout the website. Form is consistent throughout the site. Links to YouTube.

18) Source code is readable and uses kebab-case, not camelCase.

19) "Joel Zimmerman" is given a scrolling rainbow effect with JavaScript, copied from another website.

20) Hosted on GitHub.

21) all lowercase file names that match \w+\.html

22) https and http go to my site

23,24) HTTPS on port 443; HTTP on 80 redirects to HTTPS

25) GitHub doesn't show a very steady flow of commits as I have done this project over a long time and not been consistent with commits. In future, I will have it hosted early on, which will make making frequent commits a sensible thing to do.
